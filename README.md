Maturity scale tools to identify visual maturity phases

This is where you can find tools to help identify maturity phases with visual criterias for fishes with commercial interest in Europe.

This tool is a **guide for identifying maturity phases of fish with commercial interest**. It was set up as part of the project to harmonize maturity data collection methods.

  It is composed of identification sheets for males and females of each species of fish and it provides simple comments and photos to ease the maturity phases identification.

  The maturity phases identification presented in this tools is exclusively based on visual criteria described by the **ICES 2012/2018 "WKMATCH" scale**. This scale was therefore created in an ideal of a universal scale, regardless of the species or the sex of the individual. It also falls within the respect of the species biology.
